"""Admin API authentication (§9).

Single shared key in the ``X-API-Key`` header, compared in constant time. The key
is read from ``app.state`` so tests can build an app without touching the process
environment.

Repeated failures from one address are then throttled. Constant-time comparison
defeats timing attacks and says nothing about volume, and this service listens on
the LAN with no other rate limit in front of it — one compromised device is
enough to sit and guess. The counter is deliberately in memory: an
unauthenticated request must not be able to make the service write to its
database, which is a denial-of-service in its own right.
